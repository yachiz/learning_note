Both `resample_to_image` and `sample` in PyVista are used to interpolate data from an unstructured grid onto a structured grid, but they have different characteristics and use cases. Here's a comparison between the two:

### `resample_to_image`

1. **Description**: 
   - `resample_to_image` is designed specifically for converting an unstructured grid to a uniform `ImageData` grid (a structured, regular grid with constant spacing in each direction). It uses the `vtkResampleToImage` filter.
   - It generates a voxel grid (3D pixels) that approximates the original data's spatial resolution and provides efficient access for operations like volume rendering.

2. **Performance**:
   - Generally faster than `sample` because it is optimized for resampling to regular grids and uses a more efficient algorithm for interpolation.
   - Ideal for large datasets since it can better handle memory allocation and computational efficiency.

3. **Output Grid Type**:
   - Produces an `ImageData` grid, which has uniform spacing and axis-aligned dimensions. This makes it suitable for regular grid applications like visualization and volume rendering.

4. **Interpolation**:
   - Supports nearest neighbor or linear interpolation methods for assigning values to the resampled grid.
   - Allows setting the desired grid dimensions directly, which controls the resolution and potentially reduces computational load.

5. **Use Cases**:
   - Suitable for volume rendering, visualization, and scenarios where regular grid data is needed.
   - Works well when converting unstructured data to structured data for use in simulations or machine learning models.

### `sample`

1. **Description**:
   - The `sample` function interpolates data from an unstructured grid onto any arbitrary structured grid, such as `StructuredGrid`, `ImageData`, or other grid types. It uses a `vtkProbeFilter` internally.
   - It samples the original mesh values at each point in the target grid, allowing for more flexible output grid specifications.

2. **Performance**:
   - Slower compared to `resample_to_image`, especially for large datasets, because it needs to probe each point in the target grid individually.
   - The computational cost increases with the number of points in the target grid.

3. **Output Grid Type**:
   - Can output a variety of grid types (e.g., `StructuredGrid`, `ImageData`), depending on the input grid configuration.
   - Allows more flexibility in the shape and resolution of the output grid.

4. **Interpolation**:
   - Uses interpolation based on the nearest points in the original mesh, which can be computationally expensive for fine-resolution grids.
   - Suitable when the original mesh is irregular or when custom grid configurations are required.

5. **Use Cases**:
   - Ideal for scenarios requiring interpolation onto a custom grid, such as adaptive mesh refinement, non-uniform grids, or when the target grid needs specific dimensions.
   - Better suited for cases where the grid dimensions are dictated by some physical domain requirements rather than being a simple uniform voxel grid.

| **Interpolation Methods**        | Nearest neighbor, linear                                    | Uses probing with nearest point-based interpolation          |
| **Use Cases**                    | Volume rendering, visualization, machine learning           | Custom grid interpolation, adaptive mesh refinement          |

### Recommendation
- Use `resample_to_image` for regular grids, efficient resampling, and visualization tasks where a uniform grid structure is sufficient.
- Use `sample` when flexibility in the output grid configuration is necessary or when interpolating to a non-uniform grid.
